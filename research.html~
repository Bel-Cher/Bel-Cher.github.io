	<h1>Research Summary</h1>
		<p>
			My research stems from the work of Connes, Karoubi, Feigin, Tsygan, et al., beginning in the 1980's. It was then that cyclic cohomology (and homology) was developed, and along with it, noncommutative analogues of the de Rham complex as well as pairings with K-theory that generalize Chern-Weil theory for manifolds without boundary. A natural question to then ask is, "Can we find similar noncommutative extensions when given a manifold <em>with</em> a boundary?" The algebraic set-up is easily motivated when one looks at the correspondence between cyclic Hochschild cocycles and closed de Rham currents, with "cyclic" corresponding to "closed" using Stokes' theorem and the fact that the boundary is empty. If the boundary is non-empty, then again by Stokes' theorem, we see that a given functional that corresponds to such a current (or trace) doesn't vanish under the operator (1-<i>&lambda;</i>), but rather descends to a functional on a different algebra - that of functions on the boundary.

			Originally formulated by Lesch, Moscovici, and Pflaum under the name "restricted cyclic cohomology" with motivations stemming from the above as well as examples in parameter dependent pseudodifferential operators, I have developed the cohomological framework for such a situation, namely, given a surjection between two algebras <i>A</i> to <i>B</i>, we can create the subcomplex of Hochschild cochains, <i>&phi;</i> in <i>C(A)</i>, such that (1-<i>&lambda;</i>)<i>&phi;</i> is in <i>C(B)</i>. This can be formulated as a functor from the category of "surjective algebra homomorphisms" or equivalently "ideals of algebras" to the category of chain-complexes. When viewed as such, we see that any given filtration of our algebra by ideals creates a "bridge" between the cyclic and Hochschild chain complexes - hence the name "Bridge Cohomology". Using this framework I'm working on extending the geometric results mentioned above.
